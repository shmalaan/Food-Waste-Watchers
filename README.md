# Food-Waste-Watchers


## Overview

AI-powered application that aligns with the UN Social Development Goal of reducing food waste and hunger through the use of three key features; A Image-to-Recipe Creation feature, a Portion-Control assistant feature, and a Smart Storage feature.


As a developer on this project, I implemented the Smart Storage feature which integrated AI to generate accurate storage infomration for various food items and provide detailed food storage information, the average storage life of the food item, and helpful tips to maximize freshness.

Food Waste Watchers encapsulates the core function of what the application is about, focusing on helping users manage and reduce food waste effectively. "Food Waste" highlights our primary goal of addressing the global issue of food wastage, while "Watchers" signifies our approach in guiding users on ways to maximize the food they already have, and ensure food is no longer being wasted.
The application allows users to explore different methods to maximize food freshness and minimize waste,making it a comprehensive tool for sustainable living.

## Our Solution

We created a prototype aimed at solving the issue of high demand in university career counseling appointments, where we leveraged IBM Watson Assistant. It is a chatbot that gathers and provides users with specific information from the internet for the users’ needs, in our case, information to help students explore college majors.
There are three main parts of our chatbot, which are self exploration, academic exploration, and career exploration. Users can freely navigate to the section they would like to explore. In the self-exploration part, we use a personality test to analyze an individual’s personality. From the users’ results, our chatbot will give a detailed recommendation on the potential careers suitable for them. 
Next in the academic exploration part, users can learn about the major they are interested in and get the required skills for that major. Information regarding major popularity, major role, future projection, and graduation rate are provided. Regarding the skills associated with each major, some resources reviewed by the creators of the chatbot will be provided for users to check out. 
In the last section, called career exploration, users learn more about the potential tracks of the major they are interested in. In addition, the section shows students some professional success stories regarding the specific major area, and allows users to connect with those in the story, providing users with a more enriching experience.
