## Project Overview

AI-powered application that aligns with the UN Social Development Goal of reducing food waste and hunger through the use of three key features; A Image-to-Recipe Creation feature, a Portion-Control assistant feature, and a Smart Storage feature.


As a developer on this project, I implemented the Smart Storage feature which integrated AI to generate accurate storage infomration for various food items and provide detailed food storage information, the average storage life of the food item, and helpful tips to maximize freshness. As this was my first experience utilizing VS Code and creating applications, many challenges were discovered and overcame throughout this projects lifecyle. A significant challenege was integrating Streamlit capabilities into our code which caused several setbacks, as well as learning HTML to effectively enhance the UI to ensure a user-friendly experience. Training the AI model to recognize certain things, in my case getting it to identify and markdown foods considered 'high-risk' by the FDA proved to be challeneging. However, through persistance and utilizing generative AI tools like CoPilot, we were able to overcome many of the challenegs we faced. This project not only showcases my skills in Python, Streamlit, and machine learning but also addressed the social issue of food waste by educating users on proper food management, directly promoting sustainability and reducing waste. 

## Food Waste Watchers: What is it? 


Food Waste Watchers encapsulates the core function of what the application is about, focusing on helping users manage and reduce food waste effectively. "**Food Waste**" highlights our primary goal of addressing the global issue of food wastage, while "**Watchers**" signifies our approach in guiding users on ways to maximize the food they already have, and reduce the amount of food being wasted.
The application allows users to explore different methods to maximize food freshness and minimize waste,making it a comprehensive tool for sustainable living.


## Why CASExplorer? 

In today's world, food waste continues to be a significant issue , contributing to enviornmental degradation and economic loss. Individuals and households often struggle with managing food effectively, leading to unncessary waste. Food Waste Watchers aims to address this challenege by offering a comprehensive solution to help users reduce food waste to promote sustainability and economic. While traditional methods and advice can often be overly-simplified and ineffective, Food Waste Watchers provides personalized guidance through AI technology. Our application delivers detailed and effective storage tips to maximize freshness, accurate portion-control information to avoid over-preparing, and creative recipe suggestions based on food items uses already have to reduce over-spending. 

By choosing Food Waste Watchers, users gain a practical tool that not only educates them on best practices for food preservation but also helps them make the most out of their groceries, ultimately saving money and contributing to a more sustainable planet. Our goal is to empower individuals with the knowledge and tools they need to make informed decisions about their food consumption, significantly reducing waste in their own community, and fostering a more sustainable lifestyle.

 Our prototype aims to take a different approach to: 
- Assist students who typically throw away 1/4 of their food every week.
- Assist hosueholds who want to reduce the amount of money spent on groceries a week.
- Provide innovative options to tackle the issue of food waste.
- Be a universal application that empowers college students and households to live more sustaiable.

Most importantly, our prototype aims to provide personalized, easy, and effective solutions for many people who want to decrease their spending on groceries, and promote a sustainable lifestyle. Help the world become more sustainable, one meal at a time.

## Our Solution

The creation of Food Waste Watchers started from the desire to promote sustainability through an innovative AI-driven solution. Leveraging generate AI, our application provides users with solutions that aim to use the food you already have, negating the need to overspend on groceries by getting the full value of the foods already in your home. The application has three main components: Image to recipe creation, Portion-Size calculator, and Smart Storage feature. 

My focus was on the Smart Storage section, which allosws user to input various food items they have in their pantry/fridge and recieve tailored storage advice that allows the user to ensure optimal freshness of their foods, and effectively reduce waste. Building the feature using OpenAI's API as the foundation, I was able to quickly develop the feature using Python, CoPilot, and VS Code to be able to deploy the application and begin building prototypes. What started as a simple input box asking the user to list foods they have, transformed into a working feature that takes input provided by the user and is able to generate information such as detailed guidelines for proper storage, helpful ways to maximize freshness of foods, and a timeline of how long the food will be good for, all while being able to identify foods considered 'high-risk' which require more attention when storing. Supplemental infomration is also provided within the feature, providing users with valuable resoucres to learn from should they be more interested in learning about careful food storage. The main goal of the feature was to encourage users to make the most out of foods they already have, and that with the right guidance they can decrease their spending while increasing their food options. 

Image-to-Recipe creation was created by my groupmates, and gave users the ability to snap pictures of their fridge and recieve multiple detailed recipe lists that utilizes what is shown in the image. This innovative tools was built on similar foundations as the previous feature, and is meant to educate users on the different meals that can be created already using what they have in their fridge currently. Rather than settle for takeout when it may seem like you don't have any meals you could make at home, I strongly suggest using this feature to begin reducing waste and build your culinary skills by discovering and easy recipes. Similar to that we have the portion-control feature, which aims to ask the user for a list of foods and then gives the user accurate portion control sizes to reduce over-preparing and/or extend the life of foods. The feature is meant to discourage food waste through over-preparing and maximize the usability of the foods provided in the list.

Overall, these features combined are powerful tools to be used by an individual to give them the power of reducing food waste right from their smartphone.
